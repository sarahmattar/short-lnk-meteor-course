# short-lnk-meteor-react

This is a link shortening application built with Meteor and React. It takes a full length URL (i.e. - https://yoururlhere.com) and shortens it to a UUID (v4) of several characters and numbers. 

It was a tutorial app for Andrew Mead's course, [Full Stack Web Apps With React
and Meteor](https://www.udemy.com/share/1001kiAkoZcFlbRHg=/). I am currently in the process of updating it to 2019 standards: React (16.8.x) and React-Router (4.x). 

### Installation Instructions

Running the application requires Meteor to be installed. To install Meteor, go [here](https://www.meteor.com).

Install node_modules for the project:

`meteor npm install`

Launch the application:

`meteor`

### Instructions for Use

1. Create a user account. 

2. Enter a link for shortening. 

3. Visit the URL, copy it, or hide it to make it private. Hidden URL's can be accessed via clicking the "Show Hidden Links" checkbox.
